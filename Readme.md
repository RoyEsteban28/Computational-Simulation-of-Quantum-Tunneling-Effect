> **`Python 3.x`** is required.

### Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/RoyEsteban28/Computational-Simulation-of-Quantum-Tunneling-Effect.git
```

Change to the app directory:

If using a terminal
```
cd Computational-Simulation-of-Quantum-Tunneling-Effect
```
> you can exchage python3 with python depending on how it is installed in your system

Steps to run this simulation

* Install dependencies

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run python simulation

  `python3 main.py`
* Generate csv filles to plot

  `python3 get_stats.py`
> if you have the csv files, you may want to delete them before running this script 

* Plot stats
